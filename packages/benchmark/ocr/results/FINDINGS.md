# OCR Benchmark Results

Production config: **fps=2, subtitle-only, text_score=0.45** (342 frames from 170s 720p anime video).

## 5-Engine Comparison (fps2-so-ts0.45)

| Engine | Frames | Segs | CER | FP | Missed | Inf (s) | RTF | vs C++ |
|--------|--------|------|-----|----|--------|---------|-----|--------|
| **C++ (PP-OCRv3)** | 341 | 75 | **0.36%** | 0 | 0 | 91.6 | 0.539 | — |
| Python (PP-OCRv3) | 341 | — | — | — | — | ~180 | ~1.06 | — |
| Node.js (PP-OCRv3) | 341 | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| **oar-ocr (v6 tiny)** | 341 | 88 | **6.44%** | 7 | 0 | **30.8** | **0.181** | **3.0× faster** |
| Rust ORT (PP-OCRv3) | 341 | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |

C++ at fps2 achieves **near-perfect accuracy**: 0.36% CER (2 chars wrong, normalized to 1), 0 missed segments, 0 false positives, exact match on all 75 GT segments.

oar-ocr is **3× faster** (RTF 0.181 vs 0.539, ~90ms/frame) but trades accuracy for speed:

- **CER 6.44%** (6ppt higher) — mainly from 7 false positive segments ("Ra", "E", "11", "11AA1", "14144449", "OTTO", "mE") from scene text/UI digits leaking through.
- **0 missed GT segments** — detection coverage matches C++ at fps2.
- False positives are all scene noise (bottom-of-frame UI text) that don't get filtered because PP-OCRv6 tiny's detection + oar-ocr's `use_dilation=false` produces weaker contours.

## Root Cause

PP-OCRv3 models are incompatible with oar-ocr v0.7.1 — `use_dilation=false` is hardcoded in `TextDetectionAdapterBuilder` (C++/Python use `true`). Without dilation, the thresholded heatmap mask is too thin/fragmented for contour detection. PP-OCRv6 tiny detects text but with lower precision → scene noise leaks through.

## Verdict

**oar-ocr not recommended for production.** Speed advantage (3× vs C++) does not justify 6ppt higher CER. Would be viable if:
- `use_dilation` is exposed as config knob → enables PP-OCRv3 support
- Or PP-OCRv4 detection model tested with better tiny-model accuracy
